## 📝 Project Description
Our chess game is just like normal chess.
We implemented the back-end part using c++.
The board is a vector of classes representing chess pieces and empty spots.
We also built a class named 'Point' to access each and every spot on the board. 
What makes our project unique is its efficient polymorphism-based structure, and the Point class.

## 💡 Main Challenges
```
Challenge 1: We had a hard time deciding on one structure for this complicated project.
Solution: We understood that some things change midwork and it's ok.

Challenge 2: Amiram was at a trip to Eilat for 6 days, which made it hard for Malachi to work alone and
for Amiram to understand the code when he returned.
Solution: Malachi worked a lot (and he deserves praise for it). Amiram analyzed the code until he understood it completely.
```

## 📚 What we Learned
1. How complicated it is to work with another person, no matter who it is or how much you get along.
2. A project's structure can change midwork.
3. How effiect polymorphism actually is.

## 🤝 Team Collaboration
```
How we collaborated: Mostly Discord using screenshare.
Main challenges of working together: Different ideas regrading the structure of the project.
How we solved conflicts: Each one of us needed to let go of a couple of ideas, we also checked which ones are the most efficient.
What we learned about teamwork: Both members of the team need to work equally and communicate.
